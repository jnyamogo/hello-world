# hello-world
first time in github
I'm teaching myself web development because, I've always had a passion for computer software and I'd want to hae the knowledge and skills to create my own in the future. Currently I'm learning how to make a responsive website. Its fun to see progress as I started with the basics and now I'm doing more challenging things. Hope to make a good website in the next few months.
